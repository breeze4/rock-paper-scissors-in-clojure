Implementation of the game Rock Paper Scissors in clojure using various data stores. To get started:

* Create a [Facebook application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). Needed for user authentication. To disable authentication have a look at [wrap-mock-login in web.clj](https://github.com/jankronquist/rock-paper-scissors-in-clojure/blob/master/core/src/com/jayway/rps/web.clj).
* Install [rock-paper-scissors-core](https://github.com/jankronquist/rock-paper-scissors-in-clojure/tree/master/core)

Checkout the different implementations:

* [eventstore](https://github.com/jankronquist/rock-paper-scissors-in-clojure/tree/master/eventstore)
